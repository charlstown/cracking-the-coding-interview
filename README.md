## 2. Installation

To run the notebooks with the coding problems you only need to clone this repository, have Python 3.6 or higher and, Jupyter notebook 6.5 or higher. It is not necessary to install additional libraries.


## 3. Usage

The repository follows this tree structure directory:

```
cracking-the-coding-interview
├── images
│   └── ctci-cover.png
├── notebooks
│   ├── CtCI-01-SolutionsToArraysAndStrings.ipynb
│   ├── helpers.py
│   └── __pycache__
│       └── helpers.cpython-310.pyc
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

All the problems and solutions are written in notebooks inside the */notebooks* directory. The notebooks use functions from the */helpers.py* file to test solutions or print specific structures.


## 4. Troubleshooting

Errors, future updates, or beta configurations. Explain why and how it could break.


## 5. Disclaimer
