## 2. Installation

To run the notebooks with the coding problems you only need to clone this repository, have Python 3.6 or higher and, Jupyter notebook 6.5 or higher. It is not necessary to install additional libraries.


## 3. Usage

The repository follows this tree structure directory:

```
cracking-the-coding-interview                           <- Data used for the project.
├── images                                              <- Images directory.
│   └── ctci-cover.png                                  <- Image from the book cover.
├── notebooks                                           <- Notebooks directory.
│   ├── CtCI-01-SolutionsToArraysAndStrings.ipynb       <- Python notebook with solutions.
│   ├── CtCI-02-SolutionsToLinkedLists.ipynb            <- Python notebook with solutions.
│   ├── CtCI-03-SolutionsToStacksAndQueues.ipynb        <- Python notebook with solutions.
│   ├── CtCI-04-SolutionsToTreesAndGraphs.ipynb         <- Python notebook with solutions.
│   ├── CtCI-05-BitManipulation.ipynb                   <- Python notebook with solutions.
│   ├── CtCI-06-SolutionsToMathAndLogicPuzzles.ipynb    <- Python notebook with solutions.
│   └── helpers.py                                      <- Python helpers file.
├── LICENSE                                             <- License file.
└── README.md                                           <- README file with the project info.
```

All the problems and solutions are written in notebooks inside the */notebooks* directory. The notebooks use functions from the */helpers.py* file to test solutions or print specific structures.


## 4. Troubleshooting

Errors, future updates, or beta configurations. Explain why and how it could break.


## 5. Disclaimer

Explain the dos and don'ts of your app, what you take responsibility for, and where is the limit of its purpose.


## 6. Help wanted

Some extra help or clarification about the whole process. What you don't provide.
